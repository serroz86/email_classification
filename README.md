# SMART EMAIL CLASSIFIER
Email topic classification using unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms

The project is divided in four folders:

## 1) Data ingestion

This folder contains the notebook which ingests the data of the emails from the ENRON company (as example). 

## 2) Data preprocessing

This notebook preprocesses the emails.

## 3) Data analysis

This notebook has the unsupervised machine learning algorithm that classifies the emails in groups. Also can use wikipedia articles as input.

## 4) Build the model classifier

This notebook contains the model classifier with the supervised machine learning approach.
